# Texas-Hold-em-poker-
Project for a Texas Hold'em poker game. Each player receives two hole cards, and five community cards are dealt on the table. Players combine their cards with the community cards to form the best possible hand. This repository specializes in the game and will be integrated with Ponte's Casino in the future. ♠️♥️♣️♦️
