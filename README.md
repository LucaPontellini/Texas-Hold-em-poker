Features a sophisticated game engine, dynamic user interface, and operational cashier module. This project represents version 1.0 of the casino system.
  
- [Christmas-Project](https://github.com/LucaPontellini/Christmas-project.git): A comprehensive data collection system to manage users and the cashier in a casino environment. Integrates seamlessly with [Ponte's Casino](https://github.com/LucaPontellini/End-of-Year-Project-for-Computer-Science-Poker-.git) for a unified user experience.
